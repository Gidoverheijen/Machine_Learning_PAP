# Final Machine Learning in Particle and Astrophysics

This github page contains my final project for the machine learning in particle and astrophysics course. 
The page contains a jupyter notebook which has everything in it that one needs to try out the code, the image folder contains images of the loss functions and some example outputs. The notebook is set up in such a way that one can just run everything to get a working 2-step predictor.
